types of stats:  
Descriptive : needs collecting, Organizing, Summarizing, Presenting of Data, only deal with outcome from sample data  
Inferential : Making inferences, Hypothesis testing, Making predictions, Determining relationships, given the outcome, infere for the popultion
Probability Theory: Understanding the uncertainty of data, given the population and sample size, predict the probability of an outcome

descriptive generally tells you the population size, or only describes the outcome
inferential generally does not say source or population size, may make assumptions of the population based on info from the outcome, may add on further ideas to the outcome or inferences from the outcome

these 2 stats will result in different presentation of the data

280 randomly selected people in town  
210 have last name Nicolussi  
Descriptive: 220 (75%) of these 280 people have last name Nicolussi  
Inferential: 75$ of all people living in italy have the last name Nicolussi

on last 3 sundays, Henry sold 2,1,0 cars respectivly  
descriptive: Henry averaged 1 new car sold, per Sunday, for the last 3 Sundays  
inferential: Heney never sells more than 2 cars on a Sunday

Stats can be misused

Ambiguity:  
Bank A: "Our interest rates are 1% lower"  
Ambiguity 1: lower than which bank?  
ambiguity 2: if Bank B = 2%, is Bank A 1% or 1.98%  

Misleading:  
President Trump's approval rating amoing Latinos going up to 50%  
National Polling results for only 153 Latino voters  
Mean Margin of error is +- 9.9%
all stats will have margin of error  


For accuracy, should collect census of whole population but impractical/immpossible  
so use sample, which is a subset of population, which should be fair in order to infer for population

Parameter - a summary number describing population

Qualitative data:
describe characteristic / quality of variable
scale of measurement is a set of catagories  
e.g.  racial groups

Quantitative data:
numerical, differ in magnitude
can be used in calculations
scale for measurement has numerical values that represent different magnitudes of the variable  
e.g. height weight

types of quatitative data:  
Diesccrete (countable)  
Continuous (non-countable) (infinite precision and total)  

qualitative categorical data commonly presented as bar or pie chart

quantitative data can be identified as frequencey distribution as well, shown in histogram

large data set / quantitative continuous data, can use classes covering continnuous non-overlapping range of values to group data together
